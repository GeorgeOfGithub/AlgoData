1.1
find den billigste i stedet for at sortere fordi det er line√¶rt
derfor bliver o-notationen
7*2 *m = O(m)

1.1 mario
nodes er k+(k-1)+(k-2)+(k-3) op til k/2 gange
edges er k+k-1+k-2+k-3+k/2

Mario answers
state means just state, no proof
1.1 (k/2)*(k/2) = (k^2)/2 = O(k^2)

1.2 use BFS and see if end-point has been marked

1.3 use BFS and see if mushroom has been marked and find shortest route, also do this from mushroom to end-point.

BFS starts at the start-point and afterwards at the mushroom.
