Brainstorm first

write consise description in natural language of the algorithm
Dont have to re-explain algorithm, but say how you use it

find the runtime from the parameter m

sort generally vs specific sorting algorithm
i does not really matter, just state time in analysis

dont argue for specific algorithm

they dont care about why you choose an algortihm

more interested in how it is written

just chose one algorithm and analyse the time it takes

never use psuedo-code unless stated

dont argue for correct algorithm
